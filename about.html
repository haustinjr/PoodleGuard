  <h1>About Us</h1>
Dogs have always been a personal interest for the three of us.
So ten years ago, we decided that with this common interest, we just had to do something about.<BR />
        
Within two months of forming this idea, we had made the correct moves through the social connections
 we had and were now based in a small studio on the Southside of town. <BR />
        
 Not knowing where it would lead us, we first began as just a dog care service,
  but as the weeks and months passed by we realized most of our clients were poodle owners who were always on the go
  and felt their dogs just weren't fit to be left alone. This started the idea of instead of just running a dog care,
  we could begin training these poodles to learn defense against strangers. The coaching began,it was always rewarding.
  Within the ten years of startup, we have relocated to a much large studio in the same suite. Beginning with training
  just eight poodles within a 60 day time span, we now train up 20 at a time with our many coworkers within a 40 day time span.
